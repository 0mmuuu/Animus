# Animus 

This is a discord chatbot that acts as your assistant. It can create reminders, notify you of the weather and any daily news (thats the plan atleast). Keep in mind that it will have a slight hint of human likeness. 

### Progress
**Version 1:**

- It can currently use API's of various websites to get random qutoes, get the weather of a given area, and takes a screenshot of a website when asked; through commands.


**Version 2:**

- Being worked on at this moment :
                
     Trying to make it be able to recognize the user's question during a conversation and answer in a natural way rather than using commands.

  

### Questions
**Why not just use a AI API so its easier?**

- Since that is too easy, I wanted a challenge.

**Why do you want it to have human likeness?**

- It would make it pretty unique when compared with other AI bots, and it would also help me work with datasets/data training bots.
