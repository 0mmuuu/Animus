    - Created a folder and started on the bot
    - Got the basic skeleton down and it can run

    - I have no clue what the purpose of this bot is, I will keep programming random stuff into it till I'm satisfied
    - Decided to try data-training the bot
    - I will try to make a quick bot command that outputs random quotes from a text file
    - Found a website called https://www.kaggle.com/ wich has user-uploaded datafile which can be used to train chatbots

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - After spending a long time finding a quotes datafile on kaggle and trying to format it (even AI was struggling), I realized 
        that there was an easier way.There is a website called "https://api.quotable.io/random". When you search for this website, it will give you a random quote. 
        I will make the bot use this website instead of the datafile since it will be far easier to implement than trying to format a large text 
        file with over 60,000 quotes.
    - Finished making the quotes command, and its pretty nice. The implementation was pretty easy (had to use Google Bard for help). But
        it wasn't too bad for the first attempt. For the future I don't think I need the AI's help unless it's for resources gathering or making a nlp chatbot.

    - After much searching, I found and index of public api's to use for commands. https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
        I will use this first for the weather command. The user will get details and weather for the inputted location.

    - I used the same concept as above and got the coordinates of the user's input location for the command. It took 6 hours. Help.
        - I used this website: https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/address?street=&city=&state=&zip=benchmark=Public_AR_Census2020&format=json 
        - I plugged in the user's address input after the "=" sign. Only the street address and zip code where required.
        - Firstly, I had to make sure there was proper input validation 
        - Then I had to splice the user input so that the url would accept it.
        - Got data from the website, (json file) and how to figure out how to get the coordinates from the data (took 5 hours)
        - For today I got the coordinates, and since I know how to parse through the "json dictionary of hell", I should be able to 
            plug in the coordinates to the other public api link, parse through the stuff and collect needed data and make a nice looking output in no time (hopefully)
        - The "other public api" that I mentioned above is this: https://api.weather.gov/points/39.264,-76.8609. It gives me 
            detailed information about the area, dew, humidity, wind speed, etc. 
        - I think tomorrow's goal will be to include and format all the information into a nice output.
        
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Today I will take the coordinates and send them to the weather api for information. I have yet to decide how the output will look like
        but thats smth I will do when I actually get to that part.
    - For some reason the api weather url takes the latitude and longitude (y,x) in that order, instead of taking (x,y)
    - Once I get into the JSON file for the weather api, I need to grab another link from it, and then request that link for the 
        area's weather.
    - I finished, it was pretty easy. Formatting the output was easy as well, I decided to go for a simplistic approach. It was just the 
        address and the coordinates, and under was a short description about the current weather.
    - I was working on Japanese HW and was refering to a website for help. I was curious to see if I could grab data from its HTML and print
        it in discord so that I don't have to open the website every single time. 
    - Downloaded BeautifulSoup for web-scraping the information, but whenever I try to get parse to a certain area on the page, it just
        shows me that theres nothing there, when there clearly is. This is pissing me off and its late, so Im going to bed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - After many errors, I got rid of BeautifulSoup and installed Selenium instead. It is much more powerful.
    - I set the link, program it to click on the buttons on the website so that I can access the answers, and then take a screenshot and 
        send it the user on discord.
    - HAHAHHAHAHHA it works perfectly, I have no clue why I wanted to do this, but I'm glad I did it. Now I know how to access and get
        screenshots from any site.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/2/2023
    - Its been a bit, but I've come back to add descriptions to the commands.
    - I forgot how to run the bot for a good hour and figured out that all I needed to do was type "py main.py",
        I kept doing "python main.py" and that doesn't work for some reason.
    - I successfully added a command description, but im struggling to add a argument description, since "*arg" isn't something
        you can add a description to.
    - I just realized that this was supposed to be a chatbot and that it doesn't respond to me normally anymore.
    - I will have to reformat the commands, so that I can just ask it normally:
        Instead of ">>weather (Street,Zip)", i'll just say, "Whats the weather in (address,zip)"
    - NVM that is complicated for no reason (I have no clue what I'm doing)
    - What information I made it a whole lot easier for myself and just let the bot google whatever the user wants.
        If you ask for the weather, it'll send a screenshot of the weather (from google). I dunno, we'll see.
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I'm going to call it quits here for this version of the bot. I plan to make another version, one where you can ask questions.
    So rather than using commands, it'll be built into the chatbot.
        "Whats the weather.. (location)?
        "I gotchya, here ya go: Sends you the details/screenshot"

END OF VERSION 1.
